            "MISHNA. Where did these prostrations take place? Four in the north, four in the south, three in the east and two in the west, corresponding to the thirteen gates. The southern gates are next to the western side – the Upper Gate, the Fuel Gate, the Firstborn’s Gate, the Water Gate. Why is it called the Water Gate? Because through that gate they would bring the jug of water for the water libation on Sukkot. R’ Eliezer ben Yaakov says, there the water gurgles and in the future will come out from under the threshold of the house (see Yechezkiel 47:1). Opposite these in the north next to the western side – Yochaniah’s Gate, The Offering Gate, Women’s Gate, Song Gate. Why is it called Yochaniah’s Gate? Because Yochaniah left for exile through that gate. On the east – Nikanor’s Gate, which had two wickets, one on the left and one on the right. Two on the west which have no name: ", 
            "GEMARA The Mishna is taught according to the opinion of Aba Yose ben Yochanan who said that there were thirteen prostrations parallel to the thirteen gates. Rabbanan said that there were seven gates in the Temple Courtyard. According to Rabbanan, where did these prostrations occur? Like that which it teaches over there – there were thirteen breaches that the kings of Greece made there (in the Courtyard). The Hasmoneans came, repaired them and instituted thirteen prostrations in response to them. "

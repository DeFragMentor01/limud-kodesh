            "From when may one recite Shema in the evening? From the time the Kohanim go in to eat their Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], to the end of the first watch, says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn. It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited Shema. He to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it. [This is true] Not only in this case; saying, in all cases where the Sages said [some precepts can be performed] only until midnight — their obligations remain until the break of dawn. [e.g.] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] — those precepts [can be performed] until the break of dawn. [e.g.:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — their precepts [of eating them can be performed] until the break of dawn. If that is so, why did the Sages say, \"until midnight\"? To distance a person from transgression....", 
            "Thus we learn from the time that the Kohanim (Priests) enter to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption). Rabbi Chiya taught: From the time that people were accustomed to eating their meals on erev Shabbos (the evening of the Sabbath) And he taught these opinions were equal."
        ], 
        [
            "But wait! (we have an objection to offer): When the priests enter to eat Terumah, it is still day, and the stars are not yet out, whilst on the other hand, when the people sit down to the Friday evening's meal, it is generally an hour or two after nightfall. How, then, can we admit that the two opinions coincide? R. Yosse answers that it relates to the small villages, the inhabitants of which leave the fields before nightfall, in order to avoid the wild beasts. It has been taught that \" He who recites the evening prayer before that hour has not fulfilled his obligation.\" If this is so, why is it done at the Synagogue? R. Yosse replies: It is not recited in the Synagogue as a matter of duty, but in order to remain in prayer after the study of the Law. R. Zeira, speaking in the name of R. Jeremie, says: If one is uncertain of having said grace before meals, it must be re-said, for it is a law written in the Torah: \" When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 8:10). If there is a doubt of having said the prayer , it is not to be said again, for it is only prescribed by the Rabbis. This is contrary to the opinion of R. Yohanan, who says: Would to God that man would pray all the day, for prayer (even repeated) is never lost\". As regards the question relative to the recital of the Shema', this is a question to be resolved by the following rule: It has been taught that if the Shema is recited before the appointed time, the duty has not been accomplished. Now, is there not, at the moment preceding the time appointed, a doubt whether it is day or night? Therefore, in case of doubt, the Shema must certainly be said.What is the material indication of the hour at which the priests eat Terumah? The appearance of the stars. Nothing proves this in an irrefutable manner, but there is, on this subject, an allusion in the Bible (Nehemiah 4:21): \"So we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared;\" and further, \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour in the day\" (Nehemiah 4:22). Thus the duration of the day and the night are determined. How many stars should be visible to make it night? R. Pinchas, in the name of R. Abba bar-Papa, says: When only one star is to be seen, it is still day; when two are to be seen, it is doubtful; but when three are to be seen, night has certainly fallen. How can it be maintained, that when two stars are out it is doubtful? Is it not said: \"When What is the material indication of the hour at which the priests eat Troomd? The appearance of the stars. Nothing proves this in an irrefutable manner, but there is, on this subject, an allusion in the Bible (Neb. iv. 21): \"So we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared;\" and further, \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour in the day\" (Neh. iv. 22).

How can it be maintained, that when two stars are out it is doubtful? Is it not said: \"When the stars appear\" which means at least two stars? Yes, but the first one does not count. If on Friday evening, one star being visible, work is still going on, there is no transgression of the Sabbath;"
        ], 
        [
            "If two stars are out there is a doubt, and the \"trespass offering\" must be made (Lev. v. 16). If three stars are out, the sin offering must be made (in case of transgression). And therefore, if on Saturday evening work is done while one star is visible, the sin.offering is necessary; if two stars are out, the doubt must be atoned for; if there are three stars out, there has been no transgression. R. Yossc bar-Aboon mentions, in support of this (doubtful case): If we admit that there is a doubt when two stars are out, it follows that if a man work on Friday evening after two stars are out, and continues work after having been warned, and if he do the same on Saturday evening, an inevitable dilemma will arise; for, if in the first case it is still day, it must also be admitted to be day in the second case, and therefore there would be transgression of the Sabbath; and if in the second case, night has already set in, the same must be admitted for the previous day, and therefore there would be transgression. And again: If a man cuts half a fig on Friday evening after two stars are visible, and in the morning he cuts the other half, and he again cuts another half on Saturday evening after two stars are out, then we must reason that, if in the first case it is still day, it is also day in the last case; add the half done in the morning to the half done on Saturday evening, the result is a transgression then accomplished; if in the second case it is night, it would be the same in the first case, and by adding the morning's work to that of Friday evening, there would be a transgression in the first case.", 
            "What has been said about the stars, applies to those which are not generally seen until nightfall; for, no note is taken of those which appear before the day is terminated. Therefore, R. Yosse bar R. Aboon says: It means three stars not counting, R. Jacob from Darom (south) says: One star indicates that it is still day; but two stars certainly show that it is night. Is there any doubt of this? No; the doubt can only exist between the stars visible by day, and the other stars.", 
            "With regard to this, we are taught that it is still day as long as the sky is red towards the east;"

            "If it becomes shadowy, the intermediate period (twilight) has arrived. If darkness has set in, so that the upper atmosphere has become indistinguishable from the lower, night has arrived. Rabbi says: When, at the period of the new moon, the sun commences to go down and the moon to appear, it is twilight."
        ], 
        [
            "R. Hanina says: The sun must have gone down and the moon have commenced to rise. In effect R. Samuel says: The moon cannot shine as long as the sun still lightens, neither can the moon shine after the sun has darted his (morning) beams. R. Samuel bar-Hiya, in the name of R. Hanina, says: If a man, when the sun has begun to set, descends from the summit of Mount Carmel to bathe in the sea, and re-ascends to partake of the oblations, he has certainly bathed during the daytime. It is, however, only a certainty in the case of one taking cross-roads to shorten the route; but not in the case of one who follows the high road (Strata). What is meant by \"the intermediate period \"? R. Tanhooma says: It resembles the delay of a drop of blood placed on the edge of a sword, i.e. the time required for the drop of blood to divide and run down on either side of the blade, is equivalent to the period of transition. According to R. Nehemiah, it means the time it would require for a man to run half a mile, after sunset. R. Yosse says: This twilight lasts no longer than the twinkling of an eye, and not even the men of science could measure it.", 
            "Whilst the R. Yosse and R. Aha were together, the former said to the latter: Does it not seem to you that the passage of this half a mile (twilight) lasts but a second? It is certainly my opinion, said R. Aha. However, R. Hiya does not say so, but each twinkling of an eye, measured by the duration of the passage of half a mile (as R. Nehemiah), is doubtful. R. Mena says : I have made an objection in the presence of R. Aha: Have we not learnt elsewhere, that if an impurity is seen, once during the day and again during the intermediate period, or once in the twilight and again on the morrow, when the certainty exists that the impurity dates partly from this day and partly from the next day, there is a certainty as to the circumstances of the impurity, and the sacrifice is obligatory. "
        ], 
        [
            "But if the doubt exists, that the sight of the impurity dates partly from to-day and partly from the morrow, the impurity is certain, but the sacrifice uncertain. On account of this, R. Hiya bar-Joseph answered in the presence of B. Yohanan: Who is it who taught that one of these occasions of impurity can be divided into two? It was R. Yosse. He answered: You thus refute your own opinion; for you say that each twinkling of an eye of the time accomplished in a half-mile, according to R. Nehemiah, is doubtful, and not only the end of it. No contradiction can be offered to this; when the Prophet Elijah shall return to this world, and will explain to us what this twilight means, no one will contest him. R. Hanina argued against the disciples of the Rabbis: Since, said he, it is night as soon as three stars are visible, be the sun still high in the heavens, the same must apply (before the day) in the morning. R. Abba said: It is written (in Gen. xix. 23) : \"The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar;\" and is written (in Lev. xxii. 7): \"And when the sun is down he shall be clean.\" The sunrise is compared with the sunset: As sunset corresponds to the disappearance of the sun from the sight of man, so also sunrise is manifested by the appearance of the sun to the eye of man."
        ], 
        [
            "R. Aha said: It is written (in Gen. xliv. 3): \"As soon as the morning was light.\" The Tori calls the light \"morning.\" R. Ishmael taught: It is written \"every morning,\" so as to give a limit for him who desires to know when the morning commences. R. Yosse bar R. Aboon said: If you think to call night, the time that the sun takes to traverse the heavens (from dawn to radiancy), it would be equivalent to saying that the day and the night do not resemble each other (the night would lengthen out to the morning by this addition; but we are taught that on the first day of the Equinox of Nissan ', and on the first day of the Equinox of Tissri, the day and the night are equal). R. Hoona says: One can accept the usual custom as a term of comparison. Thus, when the king starts to go out, he is said to be out; but when he commences to return, he is not said to be returned, until it is an accomplished fact (it is the same with the sun).", 
            "In standing up to recite the Prayer ('Amida), the feet must be met. There are two opinions on this subject, viz. that of R. Levi, and that of R. Shimon. The one says: it is to imitate the angels; the other says: it is to imitate the priests. The latter opinion is founded on the verse, \" Neither shalt thou go up by steps to mine altar\" (Exod. xx. 2); for the priests had to go to the altar by placing the toe beside the heel, and the heel beside the toe (i.e. by taking very little steps). The former opinion is based on the verse, \" And their feet were straight feet\" (Ezek. i. 7). Now, II. Hanina bar-Andira, in the name of R. Samuel bar-Zootai, says : The angels have no knee-joint, according to (Dan. vii. 16), \" I came near unto one of them, that stood (always) by.'\" R. Hoona says: If one sees the priests in the Synagogue at the time of their first blessing of the people, one must say: «' Bless the Lord, ye his angels\" (Ps. ciii. 20); if at the second benediction: \"Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts\" (Ps. ciii. 21); if at the third benediction: \"Bless the Lord, all his works\" (Ps. ciii. 22).

Rabbi Yirmiya asked before Rabbi Zeira: What if the bathhouse was used for bathing during the hot days (i.e., summer) but not used for bathing during the rainy days (i.e., winter)?

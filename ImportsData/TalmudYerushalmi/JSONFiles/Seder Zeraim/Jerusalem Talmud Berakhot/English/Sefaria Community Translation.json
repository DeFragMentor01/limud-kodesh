            "From when may one recite Shema in the evening? From the time the Kohanim go in to eat their Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], to the end of the first watch, says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn. It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited Shema. He to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it. [This is true] Not only in this case; saying, in all cases where the Sages said [some precepts can be performed] only until midnight — their obligations remain until the break of dawn. [e.g.] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] — those precepts [can be performed] until the break of dawn. [e.g.:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — their precepts [of eating them can be performed] until the break of dawn. If that is so, why did the Sages say, \"until midnight\"? To distance a person from transgression....", 
            "Thus we learn from the time that the Kohanim (Priests) enter to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption). Rabbi Chiya taught: From the time that people were accustomed to eating their meals on erev Shabbos (the evening of the Sabbath) And he taught these opinions were equal."

            "But wait! (we have an objection to offer): When the priests enter to eat Terumah, it is still day, and the stars are not yet out, whilst on the other hand, when the people sit down to the Friday evening's meal, it is generally an hour or two after nightfall. How, then, can we admit that the two opinions coincide? R. Yosse answers that it relates to the small villages, the inhabitants of which leave the fields before nightfall, in order to avoid the wild beasts. It has been taught that \" He who recites the evening prayer before that hour has not fulfilled his obligation.\" If this is so, why is it done at the Synagogue? R. Yosse replies: It is not recited in the Synagogue as a matter of duty, but in order to remain in prayer after the study of the Law. R. Zeira, speaking in the name of R. Jeremie, says: If one is uncertain of having said grace before meals, it must be re-said, for it is a law written in the Torah: \" When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 8:10). If there is a doubt of having said the prayer , it is not to be said again, for it is only prescribed by the Rabbis. This is contrary to the opinion of R. Yohanan, who says: Would to God that man would pray all the day, for prayer (even repeated) is never lost\". As regards the question relative to the recital of the Shema', this is a question to be resolved by the following rule: It has been taught that if the Shema is recited before the appointed time, the duty has not been accomplished. Now, is there not, at the moment preceding the time appointed, a doubt whether it is day or night? Therefore, in case of doubt, the Shema must certainly be said.What is the material indication of the hour at which the priests eat Terumah? The appearance of the stars. Nothing proves this in an irrefutable manner, but there is, on this subject, an allusion in the Bible (Nehemiah 4:21): \"So we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared;\" and further, \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour in the day\" (Nehemiah 4:22). Thus the duration of the day and the night are determined. How many stars should be visible to make it night? R. Pinchas, in the name of R. Abba bar-Papa, says: When only one star is to be seen, it is still day; when two are to be seen, it is doubtful; but when three are to be seen, night has certainly fallen. How can it be maintained, that when two stars are out it is doubtful? Is it not said: \"When What is the material indication of the hour at which the priests eat Troomd? The appearance of the stars. Nothing proves this in an irrefutable manner, but there is, on this subject, an allusion in the Bible (Neb. iv. 21): \"So we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared;\" and further, \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour in the day\" (Neh. iv. 22). Thus the duration of the day and the night are determined. How many stars should be visible to make it night? R. Pinchas, in the name of R. Abba bar-Papa, says: When only one star is to be seen, it is still day; when two are to be seen, it is doubtful; but when three are to be seen, night has certainly fallen."

            "This reinforces what Rabbi Yitzhak said about Rabbi Yohanan: that until the bath-keeper Yaakov came, he wore them [tefillin]. Rabbi Yirmiya asked before Rabbi Zeira: What if the bathhouse was used for bathing during the hot days (i.e., summer) but not used for bathing during the rainy days (i.e., winter)? He said to him: a bathhouse, even if not used for bathing, [is analogous to the rules] for a bathroom that does not contain feces. Mar Ukva said: a pig is like a moving bathroom. Rabbi Yonah inquired: what is [the law] for a pebble [with feces on it] that is on the sea shore? Rabbi Ammi the doctor said: Rabbi Yirmiya taught that one should pass it while covered in a scarf; this ruling is rejected. Rabbi Zeira, in the name of Abba bar Yirmiya:  one may eat a snack with [tefillin] on, but not a meal. [Similarly, one may] take a nap, but not sleep with them on. There are tannaitic rabbis who teach: One says a blessing once. There are tannaitic rabbis who teach: One says a blessing twice. How is the one who said  once be correct? The one who said that one blesses twice [says so because] he ate and they aren't on him. Rabbi Zeira said that Abba bar Yirmiya [is referring] to a person that only eats snacks. Rabbi Zeira, in the name of Rabbi Abba: A person should not enter a urinal if a [holy] book and tefillin are in his hands. When Rabbi Yohanan had a book in his hand [and wanted to urinate] he would give it to someone else. When he had on his tefillin, he would stand with them. A baraita argues against Abba bar Yirmiya: a person may enter a urinal if a book and tefillin are in his hands. Rabbi Zeira said that Abba bar Yirmiya [is referring to two cases, one applies] to someone who can wear them, [and the other] to someone who cannot wear them. After all, why should he spoil them if cannot even fulfill the commandment? Initially, people would give them [tefillin] to other people, but those people would take them and run away. So they decreed that they should be placed in holes [in the wall]. When it happened "

So too one should not take leave of their friend through talk, laughter or levity and not through empty things, but rather from within words of Torah. So we find among the first prophets who would seal their word with words of praise and consolation. R’ Elazar said ‘except Jeremiah who finished with words of rebuke. R’ Yochanan replied to him, he too sealed his word with words of consolation “…so shall Babylon sink and not rise…” (Jeremiah 51:64). Since Jeremiah goes back and prophecies on the destruction of the Holy Temple, perhaps he sealed his words with the destruction? That is why the verse continues “Until here are the words of Jeremiah,” (ibid.) - he sealed his words with the fall of those who destroyed it. And no one sealed their words with rebuke?! Isn’t it written, “…and they shall be an abhorring for all flesh.” (Isaiah 66:24)? That is dealing with the idolators. Isn’t it written, “For you have utterly rejected us…” (Eicha 5:22)? "

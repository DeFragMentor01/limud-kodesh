            "...He teaches, one should not stand up to pray from within talk, laughter or levity and not amidst empty things, rather from within words of Torah. So too one should not take leave of their friend through talk, laughter or levity and not through empty things, but rather from within words of Torah. So we find among the first prophets who would seal their word with words of praise on consolation. R’ Elazar said ‘except Yirmeyahu who finished with words of rebuke. R’ Yochanan replied to him, he too sealed his word with words of consolation “…so shall Babylon sink and not rise…” (Yirmeyahu 51:64). Since Yirmeyahu goes back and prophecies on the destruction of the Holy Temple, perhaps he sealed his words with the destruction? That is why the verse continues “Until here are the words of Jeremiah,” (ibid.) - he sealed his words with the fall of those who destroyed it. And no one sealed their words with rebuke?! Isn’t it written, “…and they shall be an abhorring for all flesh.” (Yeshayahu 66:24)? That is dealing with the idolators. Isn’t it written, “For you have utterly rejected us…” (Eicha 5:22)? "
